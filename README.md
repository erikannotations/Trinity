### Install Jupyter Notebooks and Python with Anaconda 

[Install Anaconda (Python 3.8)](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section). 

Pick the version appropriate for your operating system (Windows, Mac, Linux). 
Make sure you choose 'Python 3.8' (not 'Python 2.7'). Choose the "64-bit graphical installer".

Once it has installed, [open Anaconda Navigator](http://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/user-guide/getting-started/#open-navigator).

### Download the Notebooks from GitHub (here!) and run the Notebook from Anaconda

Download one of the notebooks from the Notebooks folder above. Save it to a directory where you
will keep your work for this course.

Run Anaconda Navigator and open the card for Jupyter Notebook (not 
JupyterLab). Click on the 'Launch' button. This opens a web page at **http://localhost:8888/tree** that shows your whole file system. Navigate to where you downloaded the course notebooks, and click on one to run it.
